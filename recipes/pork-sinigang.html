        <p>
            Sinigang is a Filipino soup cooked with pork. 
            Serve with rice and for additional sauce, use soy or fish sauce
            If you want to, you can add what Filipinos call gabi gabi,
            which is a small taro root. When peeled they look like potatoes.
            You can add five to six of them when you add the water and make
            sure they are cooked through. Take them out when they are cooked
            because they can get too soft.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
                Add onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent,
                about 5 minutes. Season with salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in ginger, tomatoes, and pork chops. Cover
                and reduce heat to medium-low. Turn the pork
                occasionally, until browned.

            <li>
                Pour in water and tamarind soup base. Bring to a boil,
                then reduce heat and simmer until the pork is tender
                and cooked through, about 30 minutes.
