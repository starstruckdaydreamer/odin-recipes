    <h1>Pork Menudo</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/menudo.jpg">
    <p>another one taken from Panlasang Pinoy; both recipe and description</p>
    <p>
        Filipino Pork Menudo has a bit of preparation compared
        to regular Pinoy pork stews. The potato and carrot needs
        to be prepared by pan-frying. I also saute the liver in
        ground ginger to make it less gamey. This is a proven method
        that can make non-liver fans start to eat it. The actual
        cooking starts once these ingredients are ready.
